# Diagrams — Coding Society

This folder contains Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) for the Coding Society project in Mermaid format.

Files:
- `dfd_level_0.mmd` — Context-level DFD (system boundary and external actors).
- `dfd_level_1.mmd` — Level-1 DFD (major processes and data stores).

How to view:
- In VS Code: install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" or "Mermaid Preview" extension and open the `.mmd` file or preview the Markdown.
- In a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (e.g., Obsidian, GitHub Pages with Mermaid enabled) the diagrams will render automatically.
- Online: paste the Mermaid content into the Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/) to preview and export as SVG/PNG.

Notes:
- These diagrams are authored as Mermaid flowcharts. They are intended as DFD-style visualizations; you can enhance or convert them to PlantUML or any other tool if needed.
- If you want editable vector diagrams, export from Mermaid Live Editor to SVG and check it into `docs/diagrams/`.

Suggestions for next steps:
- Add Level-2 DFDs for specific subsystems (e.g., detailed Learning Engine flows, Authentication refresh flows).
- Generate SVG/PNG exports for inclusion in the SRS document.
